                    <p>Interpolation is the mathematical act of creating new data from existing data. It’s sort of like interpretating. you are given some information and you can interpret things that aren’t specifically part of that information but you have enough that your best guess fills in the blanks quite well. A really simple example of interpolation would be as follows: You are given a graph with two points on it, if you drew a straight line between the two points that would be an example of linear interpolation. All the points that line crosses would be interpolated points.</p>

                    <h1>Types of interpolation.</h1>

                    <p>Like the example above the simplest form of interpolation is linear, this is just connecting the data with a straight line. The next type is a smoother version of linear interpolation called polynomial interpolation which just uses a different mathematical formula to the linear one to get a smoother result. </p>

                    <h1>Where its used.</h1>
                    <p>Interpolation is mainly used for animation. Before there was interpolation if you wanted something animated you had to draw every individual frame in order to create the illusion of motion. But thanks to computers and the interpolation calculations they can perform all you need to do is set up something called keyframes and let the computer do the rest. Of course, interpolation isn’t magic. Say you want a square to move from one side of your animation to the other. If you just give it the first keyframe where it’s on one side and the last keyframe where it’s on the others, it’s not going to know that you also wanted it to do a flip in the middle. That’s where you need to go in and add some keyframes in the middle to help out the computer. Still requires some manual input but is much faster than the old way of frame by frame.</p>
